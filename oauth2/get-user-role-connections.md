# Get User Role Connections

Code for this

```javascript
OAuth2.getUserRoleConnections(access_token, applicationID).then((x) => {
    console.log(x)
}).catch((x) => {
    console.log(x)
})
```

Yeah fun fact, I made this function and I have no clue how to use it :tada:. Oh never mind this is apparently disabled :/
